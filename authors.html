          <h2>Tutorial Presenters</h2>
		  <h3>Georgios Kopanas</h3> 
		  Coming soon
			<h3>Bernhard Kerbl</h3> 
		  Bernhard is a principal project investigator at TU Wien. 
He obtained his PhD at Graz University of Technology for his research into GPU scheduling, real-time rendering, parallel data structures and geometry processing. 
He has published papers on these topics at major computer science venues, including Eurographics, ACM CHI and SIGGRAPH.
His interests include real-time rendering, parallel programming and high-performance computing. 
Bernhard regularly reviews technical papers for top-tier venues and has been part of the IPC for the Eurographics and High-Performance Graphics conference venues.
He has taught graphics and GPU programming-related courses at three Austrian universities. <a href='mailto:kerbl@cg.tuwien.ac.at'>Mail</a> <a href='https://snosixtyboo.github.io/'>Homepage</a> <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernhard-kerbl-283b8679/'>LinkedIn</a>
<h3>Jonathon Luiten</h3> 
		  Jonathon Luiten recently joined Meta Reality Labs as a Research Scientist. His main research interest in dynamic scene understanding. He recently obtained his PhD from Aachen University under the supervision of Bastian Leibe. During his PhD he visited Carnegie Melon University and worked with Deva Ramanan. He has already published a few papers using 3D Gaussian Splatting in the topics of 3D tracking and SLAM. <a href='mailto:jonoluiten@gmail.com'>Mail</a>
<h3>Antoine Guedon</h3> 
		  Antoine Guedon is a Phd Student in Imagine computer vision team in Ecole de Pont ParisTech and is co-advised by Vincent Lepetit and Pascal Monasse. He is interested in Image-Based Rendering and 3D reconstruction. He has worked in developing scalable approaches for simultanesouly learning to reconstruct and explore 3D environments. He also authored SuGAR that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for surface reconstruction. <a href='mailto:antoine.guedon@enpc.fr'>Mail</a>
